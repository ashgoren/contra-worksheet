### Contra Worksheet 

Questions are noted and automatic calculations are indicated with `->`.

Note that questions are asked in what seems like a logical order for filling it out, and my idea is that this would output relevant info for the committee to the history tab of the bookings spreadsheet *and* also output a PDF to be sent to the treasurer with whatever info is needed on that (likely everything), including the talent initials.
