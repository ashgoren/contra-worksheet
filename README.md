### Contra Worksheet 

Questions are noted and automatic calculations are indicated with `->`.

Note that questions are asked in what seems like a logical order for filling it out, and my idea is that this would output relevant info for the committee to the history tab of the bookings spreadsheet *and* also output a PDF to be sent to the treasurer with whatever info is needed on that (likely everything), including the talent initials.

### Some notes:

- I'm not calculating net cash received minus memberships & donations. But do we need that? If so, we need to ask how much of memberships were cash, etc.

- It needs to be possible for person filling this out to update values later during the night (if find more cash etc)

- It needs to display to us talent grid and how much we need to write a check to PCDC. 

- Getting initials is the very last thing we do, so helpful to have that be the last thing to show up.

### Questions:

- What is PCDC profit if >4 musicians?
- Is evening deposits really *total cash in box* + checks?
